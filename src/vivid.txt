Hi David

I think I've managed to isolate all relevant stuff you'll need to change to
the files interf.h and interf.c.  Just search these files for the string
IS_WEB to see where you'll need to add code for the web interface.  With
luck you can ignore most of interf.c.

To compile you'll need to use a linux version of the webmake.bat file.  I
suspect that this will require different NASM options (not sure what linking
options linux uses).  I *hope* that the assembler part in z80cpux.asm will
not require editing, but it's possible that linux and windows/dos might use 
different function munging methods.

good luck
alistair
